The following data is gotten and dumped to a CSV file.
In CSV is split into two Tables, Static/Dynamic Data. Not shown here however, variable names are accurate.
BaseStation/Parent/P
ClientRadio/Child/C


##Settings We Can Change:
- Channel   - Channel(freq)/Noise
- PTxPower  - The BaseStation's transmitted power(dBm)
- PRxGain   - The BaseStation's receiver gain(dBm)
- Bandwidth - Size of channel (MHz)


##Config Data We Provide For each Instance of Child Radio:
- CName                 - User assigned name
- PIp                   - IP for logging into GUI
- CIp                   - Ip for verifying which radio you are looking at
- AngleCAntennaToPRadio - How much off the antenna is from directly pointing at the parent radio.
                            - Clockwise is pos, CC is neg. Measured in degrees
- AnglePAntennaToCRadio - How much off the antenna is from directly pointing at the parent radio.
                            - Clockwise is pos, CC is neg. Measured in degrees
- Hdist                 - Horizontal distance between radios
- Vdist                 - Vertical distance between radios
- SpecialValueName      - Special Value, IE: "dirtFT" may indicate buried radio
- SpecialValue          - Special Value, IE: ".5" may indicate the radio is buried .5 a foot.


##Data that is provided for the BaseStation(Parent) by the GUI:
- PLocation   - GEOLocation of Parent Radio.
- PTemp       - Temperature of BaseStation
- PUpTime     - How long BaseStation has had power
- PFreeMemory - FreeMemory of BaseStation Unit


##Data that is provided for the Client(Child) by the GUI.
##Split into two groups again.
##DownLink, EAR(Enhanced Adaptive Receiver):
- DS0           - Down Signal Strength Level
- DS1           - Down Signal Strength Level

                    -  -30, Excellent
                    -  -70, good
                    -  -90, weak
                    -  -110, barely usable
- DNoiseFloor   - Down, Background Noise level in system
                    -  -120, Excellent
                    -  -100, Typical in rural areas
                    -  -90, Noisy enviroment (urban areas)
                    -  -80, Poor Reception conditions
- DSNR          - Down, 'Signal to Noise Radio' (dB)
                    -  SNR = RSSI-NoiseFloor
                    -  40, Excellent
                    -  25, Good
